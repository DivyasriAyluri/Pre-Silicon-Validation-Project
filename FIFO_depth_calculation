FIFO DEPTH CALCULATION

Given: Sender clock frequency = 500MHz
Write idle cycles = 3
Write burst size = 1024
Receiver clock frequency = 225MHz
Read Idle cycles = 2

fA > fB with idle cycles in both write and read.
Writing frequency = fA = 500MHz.
Reading Frequency = fB = 225MHz.
Burst Length = No. of data items to be transferred = 1024.
No. of idle cycles between two successive writes is = 2.
No. of idle cycles between two successive reads is = 1

1.	The no. of idle cycles between two successive writes is 3 clock cycle. It means that, after writing one data, module A is waiting for one clock cycle, to initiate the next write. So, it can be understood that for every three clock cycles, one data is written.

2.	The no. of idle cycles between two successive reads is 2 clock cycles. It means that, after reading one data, module B is waiting for 3 clock cycles, to initiate the next read. So, it can be understood that for every two clock cycles, one data is read.

3.	Time required to write one data item = 3 * 1/500MHz = 6ns

4.	Time required to write all the data in the burst = 1024 * 6ns = 6144ns

5.	Time required to read one data item = 2* 1/225MHz = 8.88ns 

6.	So, for every 8.88 nSec, the module B is going to read one data in the burst.

7.	So, in a period of 6144 nSec, 1024 no. of data items can be written.

8.	The number of data items can be read in a period of 8192nsec,
    	(6144ns / 8.88ns) = 691

9.	The remaining number of bytes to be stored in the FIFO = 1024 â€“ 691=333

10.	So, the FIFO which has to be in this scenario must be capable of storing 333 data items.

So, the minimum depth of the FIFO should be 333.
